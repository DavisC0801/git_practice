# This is a sample exercise on how to use Git.

## Branches
* Branches allow us to make changes with a specific purpose or feature in mind, then merge that code back to the master branch.
* By convention, the master branch should always be deployable and free of known bugs.
* A branch will also allow multiple people to work on separate features concurrently instead of working on the master branch at all times.
